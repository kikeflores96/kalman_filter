%LM_ALL_LMK_IDS  Recover ids of all known landmarks
%
%   IDS = LM_ALL_LMK_IDS will return the row vector IDS that contains the
%   identifiers of all landmarks known by the estimation, that is all
%   landmarks that were associated to pointers with calls to
%   LM_ASSOCIATE_POINTER_TO_LMK.
%
%   This is useful when we want to loop through all landmarks that we know.
%
%   See also init_landmark_management, lm_associate_pointer_to_lmk.
